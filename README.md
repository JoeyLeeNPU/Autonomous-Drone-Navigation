# Autonomous-Drone-Navigation-using-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning

The goal is to build an autonomous system capable of navigating areas(small scale) without the use of GPS technology. Navigation of areas involves obstacle avoidance, a decision based system to classify input camera feed for commands for obstacle avoidance. We are currently using ROS for interfacing. We might switch to flytOS depending on it's capabilities which we still have to assess.
